        "Classes & Objects → blueprint & actual entity.",

        "Data Binding → restricting direct access to data (using private/public).",
        "Inheritance → creating new classes from existing ones.",
        "Polymorphism → one function behaving differently in different contexts.",
        "Compiled Language: C++ is a compiled language, meaning the source code is converted into machine code by a compiler (like g++ or clang++). This makes it faster than interpreted languages (like Python or JavaScript) where code is executed line-by-line. Because of compilation, C++ is widely used in game engines, operating systems, real-time systems, and embedded systems.",
        "Standard Template Library (STL): STL is a collection of pre-built classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms. Saves time since you don’t have to write everything from scratch.",

        "Algorithms → Predefined functions like sort(), find(), reverse().",
        "Dynamic Memory Management: In C++, memory can be allocated at runtime using the new operator and released using the delete operator. This makes programs flexible and allows them to use memory efficiently.",
        "Exception Handling: Errors can happen during runtime (like dividing by zero, invalid input, etc.). In C, handling such errors is difficult. In C++, we use try, catch, throw for safe error handling."
